# The energy types that skills can use.
# The charging is the type of charging method the energy uses.
# AUTO - Automatically charge the energy.
# AUTO_REVERSE - Automatically decharge the energy.
# HIT - Hit entities to charge.
# KILL - Kill entities to charge.

# The elements is a list of types for the charging type.
# For example if charging method is AUTO_REVERSE this element is
# a list of mob names that you can hit to regenerate.
# Same for HIT and KILL
# However the element list doesn't do anything for the AUTO method.
# Requires server restarts for some changes to apply.
